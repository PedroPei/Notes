Laura Vanderkam - The secret of time management
http://open.163.com/movie/2016/12/I/B/MC82BCQAN_MC8U8L3IB.html

  Laura is a researcher on time management and she shared her thoughts based on her and some other successful peoole's experience.
  The main idea is that time is a choice.Sometimes when we say "I don't have time for that",it's not that we really can't find time.
It's just we don't want to use my time to do that ie. we have something more important to do.
  She mentioned a really busy woman whoes shedule is filled up.However,unfortunately her water heater breaks down and it takes her 7
hours to fix it.For god sake,it's 7 hours.Not 7 minutes.If you ask her to do something which will take her 7 hours like going for a trip
,it's obvlious that she will say"Sorry,I don't have time".But things changed when she saw the mess due to the broken heater.Why?The heater
has magic?It's just because that she has to do that.It's just because of the priority.
  Here's the thing.We are the owner of time.Even if we cannot control the flow of time,we can control the use of it.It's not just about 
time management,it's also about the truth of life.We are not slaves of things,and we are not machines whose actions are just the response
to stimulation.We are human beings.
