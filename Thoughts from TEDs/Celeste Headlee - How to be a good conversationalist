Celeste Headlee - How to be a good conversationalist
http://open.163.com/movie/2016/3/F/E/MBFLN6BJF_MBFLNJGFE.html

Main idea:
  How to talk and how to listen.
  1、Stay focused and don't multitask
  be present, be in that monment, don't be half in it and half out of it.

  2、Don't pontificate
  you need to enter every conversation assuming that you have something to learn.

  3、Use open-ended questions

  4、Go with the flow
  thoughts will come into your mind and you need to let them go out of your mind.

  5、If you dont know, say that you dont know
  talk should not be cheap

  6、Don't equate your experience with theirs
  all experiences are individual.
  people who brag about their IQs are losers.
  conversations are not a promotional opportunity.
  
  7、Try not to repeat yourself

  8、Stay out of the weeds

  9、Listen
  if your month is open, youre not learning.

  10、Be brief
  
My opinions
   I find that there are something deeply hide in the 10 rules above.
   These rules are useful but they're also practical which means they're not abstract enough.
   What I am trying to say is respecting others.
   If you respect the man who you're talking to,obviously it's rude not to listen to him,no matter how you showed yourself.It's also
 improper to act like an expert because it's not the time to show your priority or have some dishonest behavior.When you're talking,
 you're supposed to respect people's time so that it's necessary to stay out of the weeds,be brief,be honest and not to repeat yourself.
 If you want him to talk more,it's a good way to use open ended questions but don't stick your mind on some irrelevant things.
 
    You see,all the rules are just reflections of respecting others.
    Be confident,open-mind and curious about the world,and there is no reason that you won't be a good conversationalist.
    
    Like the lecturer said,keep your mind open and always prepare to be amazed.
