Main idea
  As is known to us,Vancl used to be a very sucessful brand and its value had reached up to 3 billion dollars.However,it 
failed just after the peak because of overexpansion and negligence of product quality.

  In this letter,Chen Nian looks back to the rise and decline of Vancl and shares his thoughts of the secret of running 
bussiness.
